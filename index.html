                                Hi, I'm Noah! I am a highly motivated and
                                skilled full-stack developer based in Saint
                                Louis, Missouri. I have a passion for the
                                complete development cycle of applications, from
                                front-end design to back-end implementation. I
                                am always eager to expand my knowledge and
                                skills in the ever-evolving tech industry, and I
                                am always looking for new challenges and
                                opportunities to grow as a developer.

                                In 2022, I made the switch to a career in
                                software development. One of the key highlights
                                of my experience at Hack Reactor was the focus
                                on hands-on learning. Each day, I worked on
                                challenging projects that required me to apply
                                my newly acquired skills and knowledge to
                                real-world problems.
